# App Demo

Our **library management system** app is the perfect solution for libraries looking to streamline their operations. With our desktop app, library staff can manage all transactions related to books and students, including issuing books, tracking due dates, and recording returns. The app also provides real-time updates on book availability and student borrowing history. All of these features are easily accessible on a single, user-friendly platform. Say goodbye to cumbersome paper-based systems and hello to a more efficient way of running your library. Try our library management system app today and see the difference it can make!
## The Flow Of The App

### Welcome Page

![Homepage](https://github.com/Medelouali/Library-Management-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/com/example/libraryapp/assets/demo/Screenshot%20from%202023-01-08%2012-07-21.png)
On the welcome page of our desktop app, the administrator has three options to choose from. They can sign up to create a new account, log in to their existing account, or access the app in guest mode.

In the sign up option, the administrator can create a new account by providing their personal information and creating a username, password and other info like CIN. This will allow them to access the app and its features with their own personalized account.

If the administrator already has an account, they can use the log in option to access their account with their previously created email and password.

Alternatively, the administrator can choose to access the app in guest mode, which allows them to use the app's features without creating an account or logging in. This is a convenient option for those who do not want to create an account or do not need to access the app on a regular basis.
