## The Flow Of The App

### Welcome Page

![Homepage](https://github.com/Medelouali/Library-Management-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/com/example/libraryapp/assets/demo/1-welcome-page.png)
On the welcome page of our desktop app, the administrator has three options to choose from. They can sign up to create a new account, log in to their existing account, or access the app in guest mode.

In the sign up option, the administrator can create a new account by providing their personal information and creating a username, password and other info like CIN. This will allow them to access the app and its features with their own personalized account.

If the administrator already has an account, they can use the log in option to access their account with their previously created email and password.

Alternatively, the administrator can choose to access the app in guest mode, which allows them to use the app's features without creating an account or logging in. This is a convenient option for those who do not want to create an account or do not need to access the app on a regular basis.

### LogIn Page

![Task Detail Page](https://github.com/Medelouali/Library-Management-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/com/example/libraryapp/assets/demo/2-login-page.png)
After selecting the log in option on the welcome page, the administrator will be directed to the login page. On this page, the administrator will be prompted to enter their email address and password in order to access their account.

The email address serves as the unique identifier for the administrator's account, and the password ensures the security of their account. Once the administrator has entered their login credentials, they can click the "Log In" button to access their account and the app's features.
### SignUp Page

![Task Detail Page](https://github.com/Medelouali/Library-Management-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/com/example/libraryapp/assets/demo/3-signup-page.png)
On the sign up page, the administrator is prompted to create a new account by providing the following information:

Username: A unique identifier for the administrator's account.
Email: An email address that will be used to verify the administrator's identity and allow them to reset their password if needed.
Password: A secure password that will be used to protect the administrator's account.
CIN: An optional field where the administrator can enter their CIN (Carte d'Identit√© Nationale) number.
Description: A short description or summary of the administrator's role or responsibilities within the library.
Once the administrator has entered this information and clicked the "Sign Up" button, their new account will be created and they will be logged in to the app. They can then start using the app's features with their personalized account.

While guests will be able to view the list of books, they will not have the ability to check out or reserve books, or access any other features that are reserved for registered users. To check out or reserve books, or to access other features, guests will need to create an account or log in to an existing account.
